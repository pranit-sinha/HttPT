### Request Batching

We need to collect requests, wait to fill batch, group them by service/dtype. Native lib (asyncio) should be sufficient for former. Based on docs, asyncio.Queue looks good. Max batch size/wait times can be arbitrary, can't find std perf boosting #s online. 

Maybe only batch reqs for NLP prompts, images have preprocessing overhead so might be better individually
